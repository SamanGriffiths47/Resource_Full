<h3><b>:handshake: Introduction :handshake:</b></h3>
<p>Resource Full is a full stack website, loosely inspired by Stack Overflow. You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who works in tech who has never felt the bliss of finding the exact answer they were looking for on Stack Overflow. If you're in tech, then you also know that a lot of it is about independant research and study. I wanted to create a website that could help answer the questions before they needed to become a post on Stack Overflow. I wanted to create a digital library that anyone who wants to learn a new skill in the tech space can go to to find peer endorsed resources, tried, tested, and shared by others who've already succeeded in the endeavor they've set out to conquer.</p>
